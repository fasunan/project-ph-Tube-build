              Q1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="text-green-600 font-bold">Ans:</span>
              Var, Let, and const are used for declare variable. Their work is
              just same but has some common issue.
              <br />
              1. var is is create variables that can be assigned another value.
              <br />
              2. let is also create a variables and also assigned another value.
              <br />
              3. But It is recommended to use let instead of var.
              <br />
              4. where const variables cannot assigned another value. its fixed.
              <br />
              5. If anyone don't wants to change variables should be used const.
            </p>
            <p class="text-red-500">
              Q2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="text-green-600 font-bold">Ans:</span>
              Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has
              not been assigned.
              <br />
              8 ways to get undefined
              <br />
              1. variable that is not initialized will give undefined.
              <br />
              2.function with no return will give undefined.
              <br />
              3.parameter that is not passed will be undefined
              <br />
              4. if return has nothing on the right side will give undefined
              <br />
              5.property that does not exist in object will give undefined.
              <br />
              6.accessing array element outside of the index range will show
              undefined
              <br />
              7. deleting an element inside an array will undefined.
              <br />
              8. set a value directly to undefined
              <br />
              And Null means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof()
              operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value
              is assigned as null.

            <p class="text-red-500">Q3. What do you mean by REST API?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="text-green-600 font-bold">Ans:</span>
              In my understanding , An API, (Application Programming Interface),
              is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can
              connect to and communicate with each other.A REST API
              (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
              Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for designing web
              services that enable communication and interaction between
              different software applications over the internet. REST APIs often
              use JSON for data format. It makes data accessible through
              standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE . And so on.
